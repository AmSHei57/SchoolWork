CEN4010: In this class we were tasked to learn and practice agile project development. Our project was to create an application where it would determine from the songs you have
listened to on your Spotify account a new playlist where the songs would be those that closly resembled the songs you already listen to. The language that was used was
Python due to an API readily available. Due to the Covid-19 we were unable to finish our project.
